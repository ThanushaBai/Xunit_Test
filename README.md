# Xunit_test

## Description
This repository contains a simple Calculator project in Java. I wrote automated tests using JUnit to verify basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## What I Tested
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division in `Calculator.java`
- Edge cases like division by zero

## What I Learned
- How to write automated unit tests with JUnit
- How to use Maven to manage dependencies and run tests
- How to integrate Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions
- Importance of testing early and automating tests for reliability
